## ü§ù How Can I Contribute?

### Reporting Bugs

Before creating bug reports, please check existing issues to avoid duplicates. When creating a bug report, include:

- **Clear title and description**
- **Steps to reproduce** the issue
- **Expected behavior** vs. **actual behavior**
- **Screenshots** if applicable
- **Environment details** (OS, Python version, etc.)
- **Error messages** or logs

### Suggesting Features

Feature suggestions are tracked as GitLab issues. When suggesting a feature:

- **Use a clear title** describing the feature
- **Provide detailed explanation** of the feature and its benefits
- **Explain why this would be useful** to most users
- **List alternatives** you've considered

### Code Contributions

1. **Fork the repository** and create a branch for your feature
2. **Write clear, commented code** following our coding standards
3. **Add or update tests** as needed
4. **Update documentation** to reflect changes
5. **Submit a pull request** with a clear description

## üõ†Ô∏è Development Setup

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12 or higher
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Ollama with required models
- Git

### Setup Steps

1. **Clone your fork:**
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/nimbus.git
cd nimbus
```

2. **Create virtual environment:**
```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. **Install dependencies:**
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. **Start database:**
```bash
docker compose up -d
```

5. **Copy environment configuration:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your settings
```

6. **Run the application:**
```bash
python app.py
```

### Running Tests

```bash
# Run all tests
pytest

# Run with coverage
pytest --cov=apps --cov-report=html

# Run specific test file
pytest tests/test_chat.py
```

## üìù Coding Standards

### Python Style Guide

- Follow [PEP 8](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/) style guide
- Use meaningful variable and function names
- Maximum line length: 120 characters
- Use type hints where applicable

### Code Formatting

We use the following tools for code quality:

```bash
# Format code with black
black .

# Check style with flake8
flake8 apps/

# Sort imports with isort
isort .
```

### Documentation

- Add docstrings to all functions, classes, and modules
- Use Google-style docstrings
- Update README.md for user-facing changes
- Comment complex logic

Example docstring:
```python
def parse_document(file_path: str, parser_type: str = 'pymupdf') -> str:
    """
    Parse a document and extract text content.
    
    Args:
        file_path: Path to the document file
        parser_type: Type of parser to use (pymupdf, pdfplumber, ocr)
        
    Returns:
        Extracted text from the document
        
    Raises:
        ValueError: If parser_type is not supported
        FileNotFoundError: If file_path does not exist
    """
    pass
```

### Commit Messages

Types:
- `feat`: New feature
- `fix`: Bug fix
