# üîí Security Considerations

## Default Credentials

**‚ö†Ô∏è IMPORTANT**: This application includes default credentials for development purposes only. **Change these immediately** before deploying to production!

### Default Admin Account
- **Username**: `admin`
- **Password**: `admin123`
- **Action Required**: Change password immediately after first login

### Database Credentials
- **Username**: `postgres`
- **Password**: `postgres` (in Docker setup)
- **Action Required**: Use strong passwords in production

## Security Checklist for Production

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- [ ] Change default admin password
- [ ] Create strong database credentials
- [ ] Generate secure Flask secret key (32+ characters)
- [ ] Enable HTTPS/TLS for all connections
- [ ] Configure session timeouts appropriately

### 2. Environment Configuration
- [ ] Set `FLASK_ENV=production`
- [ ] Set `FLASK_DEBUG=false`
- [ ] Use strong `FLASK_SECRET_KEY`
- [ ] Secure database connection strings
- [ ] Validate all environment variables

### 3. Network Security
- [ ] Use reverse proxy (nginx/Apache)
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Restrict database access to application only
- [ ] Use private networks for internal services

### 4. Data Protection
- [ ] Enable database encryption at rest
- [ ] Secure file upload directories
- [ ] Implement rate limiting
- [ ] Validate and sanitize all inputs
- [ ] Regular security audits

### 5. Monitoring & Logging
- [ ] Set up security monitoring
- [ ] Configure audit logging
- [ ] Monitor failed login attempts
- [ ] Set up alerting for suspicious activity

## Generating Secure Credentials

### Flask Secret Key
```bash
python -c "import secrets; print(secrets.token_hex(32))"
```

### Password Hash
```python
from werkzeug.security import generate_password_hash
print(generate_password_hash('your-secure-password'))
```

### Database Password
```bash
openssl rand -base64 32
```

## Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security vulnerability, please report it responsibly:

1. **Do NOT** open a public issue
2. Email security concerns to the maintainers
3. Provide detailed information about the vulnerability
4. Allow reasonable time for fixes before public disclosure

## Security Updates

- Regularly update dependencies
- Monitor security advisories for Python, Flask, and PostgreSQL
- Apply security patches promptly
- Review and update security configurations quarterly
